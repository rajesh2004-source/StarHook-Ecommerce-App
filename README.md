## Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named **`.env`** in the **root directory** (for the server) and a separate **`.env`** file inside the **`client`** directory (if your React app is nested). **You must provide your own MongoDB connection string and API keys.**

**Server (`.env`) Example:**

```env
# General Configuration
PORT=8090
NODE_ENV=development
DEV_MODE=development

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=[YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE]

# Authentication (JSON Web Token)
JWT_SECRET=[A_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING_FOR_JWT] 
# Use a long, complex string for security. Generate one online or use a tool.

# Payment Gateway (Braintree)
BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID=[YOUR_BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID]
BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY=[YOUR_BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY]
BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY=[YOUR_BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY]

```

**Client (`.env`) Example:**

```env
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8090
REACT_APP_ACT=[YOUR_FRONTEND_API_KEY_OR_SETTING]
REACT_APP_BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY=[YOUR_BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY]
```


## Install Dependencies & Run

#### **A. Install Dependencies**

Navigate to both the root and `client` directories to install dependencies:

```bash
# In the root directory:
npm install 

# Then, in the client directory:
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

#### **B. Start the Application**

Start the server and client in separate terminals (or use your custom run command):

```bash
# To start the server (in the root directory):
npm start  
# OR: node server.js

# To start the client (in the client directory):
cd client
npm start
```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost: [Your Client Port, e.g., 3000]`.
